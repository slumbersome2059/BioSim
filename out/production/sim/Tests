I did some tests by just running stuff instead of unit tests because
of the random nature of some of the things I couldn't narrow it down with a specific case.
Test 1:
What happens to output when there are large numbers of Herbivores?
- It looks distorted with columns not aligned
- I have allowed it to go ont a different line with columns aligned now
Does initial state load?
- No, this is why there is no plant when many herbivores initialised
- I added printOut before loop and plant now appears
Do carnivores that eat the herbivore die quicker then ones that don't?
- Tested with CARNIVORE_LOSE_ENERGY_IN_TURN = 60, CARNIVORE_EAT_ENERGY = 30, CARNIVORE_START_ENERGY =  100
- Not working -> need to decrement count to make sure to not forget to update an organism in the loop

Test: This case not working

C seems to update twice because of not taking out only if before
