I did some tests by just running stuff instead of unit tests because
of the random nature of some of the things I couldn't narrow it down with a specific case.
Test 1:
What happens to output when there are large numbers of Herbivores?
- It looks distorted with columns not aligned
- I have allowed it to go ont a different line with columns aligned now
Does initial state load?
- No,
